Vue Argon Theme
===============

This is an NPM mirror of the [Vue Argon Design System][system] that is designed
to be easier to drop-in to a project.

The [Vue Argon Design System][system] is licensed under [MIT][argon-license],
and [so is this package][theme-license].


## Usage:

```javascript
import Argon from 'vue-argon-theme'
Vue.use(Argon);
```

Then you can just use the components anywhere in Vue!

example.vue:
```html
<template>
  <base-button type="danger" outline>Don't click me!</base-button>
</template>
```
